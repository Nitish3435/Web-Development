# Web-Development 
This is a project given to us in the Advanced lab 5th semester.Here ,we hosted a site which takes the survey of the grads after passing 
from the college . A student can give the survey after entering correct SIC . The Survey records are stored in the Database.
It has a login section in which the admin can see the number pf survey and feedback taken.In the dashboard the admin can even update
the records.
